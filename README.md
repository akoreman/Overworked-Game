# Small game prototype: Overworked
Very early and rough WIP. Working on a small, overcooked style, game poking a bit of fun at research student life. Current prototype includes moving around, picking up/dropping physics items, throwing them, and one taks (getting your supervisor coffee).

<!-- Very early prototype on https://xyalice.itch.io/overworked -->
